TITLE: Demo - The Tau method

DATE: June 15, 2021


__Summary.__
Shenfun has primarily been developed for the spectral Galerkin method.
However, there are other methods out there that make use of global basis
functions and variational principles. One such method, which has a lot in
common with the spectral Galerkin method, is the Tau method. The
principle difference between a Tau method and a spectral Galerkin method
is in the choice of basis functions. The spectral Galerkin method is
usually defined through function spaces where the boundary conditions
of the problem are already built in. The tau-method, on the other hand,
usually considers
only the orthogonal basis, like pure Chebyshev or Legendre polynomials,
and derives differentiation matrices for these bases. The boundary conditions
are then usually fixed through manipulation of a couple of rows of the
differentiation matrix. In this demo we will show how the original
tau-method can be easily implemented using "shenfun":
"https://github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun".

===== The tau method for Poisson's equation in 1D =====

Poisson's equation is given on a domain $[-1, 1]$ as

!bt
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 u(x) &= f(x) \quad \text{for }\, x \in [-1, 1], label{eq:poisson}\\
u(-1)&=a, u(1)=b, \notag
\end{align}
!et
where $u(x)$ is the solution, $f(x)$ is a function and $a, b$ are two possibly
non-zero constants. To solve Eq. (ref{eq:poisson}) with the tau method we choose either
Legendre of Chebyshev basis functions $\phi_k$, and then look for
solutions
!bt
\begin{equation}
u(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \hat{u}_k \phi_k(x), label{eq:u}
\end{equation}
!et

where $N$ is the size of the discretized problem and
$\hat{\mathbf{u}} = \{\hat{u}_k\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$ are the unknown expansion
coefficients. For this function to satisfy the given boundary conditions, it is necessary
that
!bt
\begin{align}
u(-1) &= \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \hat{u}_k \phi_k(-1) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\hat{u}_{k}(-1)^k = a,
label{eq:dirichleta} \\
u(+1) &= \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \hat{u}_k \phi_k(+1) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \hat{u}_{k} = b,
label{eq:dirichletb}
\end{align}
!et
where we have use that $\phi_k(1) = 1$ and $\phi_k(-1)=(-1)^k$ for $k=0,1, \ldots, N-1$,
for either Chebyshev or Legendre polynomials $\phi_k$. This gives two equations
for the $N$ unknowns in  $\{\hat{u}_k\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$.
We will now use variational principles, like in the Galerkin method, in order to
derive equations that can be used to close the remaining $N-2$ unknowns.
To this end we multiply Poisson's equation by a
test function $v$, a weight $w$, and integrate  over the domain
!bt
\begin{equation}
\int_{-1}^1 \nabla^2 u \, v \, w\, dx = \int_{-1}^1 f \, v\, w\, dx. label{eq:varform}
\end{equation}
!et
The weight function depends on the choice of basis functions. For Chebyshev
it will be $1/\sqrt{1-x^2}$, whereas it is unity for Legendre.

Finally, we insert the trial function $u=\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\hat{u}_j \phi_j$ and
the test function $v=\phi_k$, to get

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int_{-1}^1 \nabla^2 \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \phi_j \,  \, \phi_k \, w\, dx \hat{u}_j = \int_{-1}^1 f \, \phi_k\, w\, dx. label{eq:varform2}
\end{equation}
!et

This problem can be reformulated as a linear algebra problem,

!bt
\begin{align}
a_{kj} \hat{u}_j &= \tilde{f}_k, \\
A \hat{\mathbf{{u}}} &= \tilde{\mathbf{{f}}}.
\end{align}
!et

However, the matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ is singular because it
contains two zero rows. These two rows are used to implement the two boundary
conditions. Setting $a_{N-2, j}=1$ and
$a_{N-1, j}= (-1)^j$ for $j=0, 1, \ldots, N-1$, and also fixing
the right hand sides $\tilde{f}_{N-2}=a$ and $\tilde{f}_{N-1}=b$, the
two boundary conditions will be satisfied.

===== Implementation =====

=== Preamble ===

We will solve Poisson's equation using the "shenfun":
"https://github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun" Python module. The first thing needed
is then to import some of this module's functionality
plus some other helper modules, like "Numpy": "https://numpy.org" and "Sympy":
"https://sympy.org", and the "scipy.sparse":"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html"
for handeling sparse matrices:

!bc pycod
from shenfun import inner, div, grad, TestFunction, TrialFunction, Function, \
    project, Dx, Array, FunctionSpace, dx
import numpy as np
import scipy.sparse as scp
from sympy import symbols, cos, sin, exp, lambdify
!ec

We use `Sympy` for a manufactured solution and `Numpy` for testing.
The exact manufactured solution $u_e(x)$ and the right hand side
$f_e(x)$ are created using `Sympy` as follows
!bc pycod
x = symbols("x")
ue = sin(4*np.pi*x)
fe = ue.diff(x, 2)
!ec

Note that we compute the right hand side function `fe` that corresponds to
the manufactured solution `ue`.

=== Discretization ===

We create a basis with a given number of basis functions,

!bc pycod
N = 32
T = FunctionSpace(N, 'Chebyshev')
#T = FunctionSpace(N, 'Legendre')
!ec

Note that we can either choose a Legendre or a Chebyshev basis. The
remaining code will work either way.

=== Variational formulation ===

The variational problem (ref{eq:varform}) can be assembled using `shenfun`'s
${cls('TrialFunction')}, ${cls('TestFunction')} and ${func('inner')} functions.
!bc pycod
u = TrialFunction(T)
v = TestFunction(T)
# Assemble differentiation matrix
A = inner(v, div(grad(u)))
# Assemble right hand side
fj = Array(T, buffer=fe)
f_hat = Function(T)
f_hat = inner(v, fj, output_array=f_hat)
!ec

Note that the `sympy` function `fe` is be used to initialize the ${cls('Array')}
`fj`, because an Array
is required as input to the ${func('inner')} function. An
${cls('Array')} contains the solution evaluated on the
quadrature mesh. A ${cls('Function')} represents a global
expansion, like Eq. (ref{eq:u}), and its values are the
expansion coefficients $\{\hat{u}_{k}\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$.

=== Fix boundary conditions ===

We fix two rows of the differentiation matrix in order to satisfy
Eqs. (ref{eq:dirichleta}) and (ref{eq:dirichletb}).

!bc pycod
A = A.diags('lil')
A[-2] = (-1)**np.arange(N)
A[-1] = np.ones(N)
A = A.tocsc()
f_hat[-2] = ue.subs(x, T.domain[0])
f_hat[-1] = ue.subs(x, T.domain[1])
!ec

Note that the last two lines uses evaluation of the sympy function
`ue` at the borders of the domain. Implemented like this it is
easy to change to a nonstandard domain size.
The sparsity pattern of the matrix A is now modified
with the typical tau-lines that we can visualize using "plotly":"https://plotly.com/"

!bc pycod
import plotly.express as px
z = np.where(abs(A.toarray()) > 1e-6, 0, 1).astype(bool)
fig = px.imshow(z, binary_string=True)
fig.show()
!ec

=== Solve linear equations ===

Finally, solve the linear equation system and transform the solution from the spectral
$\{\hat{u}_k\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$ vector to the real space $\{u(x_j)\}_{j=0}^{N-1}$
and then check how the solution corresponds with the exact solution $u_e$.
To this end we compute the $L_2$-errornorm using the `shenfun` function
${func('dx')}

!bc pycod
u_hat = Function(T)
u_hat[:] = scp.linalg.spsolve(A, f_hat)
uj = u_hat.backward()
ua = Array(T, buffer=ue)

print("Error=%2.16e" %(np.sqrt(dx((uj-ua)**2))))
!ec

=== Convergence test ===

To do a convergence test we will now create a function `main`, that takes the
number of quadrature points as parameter, and prints out
the error.

!bc pycod
def main(N, family='Chebyshev'):
    T = FunctionSpace(N, family=family)
    u = TrialFunction(T)
    v = TestFunction(T)

    # Get f on quad points
    fj = Array(T, buffer=fe)

    # Compute right hand side of Poisson's equation
    f_hat = Function(T)
    f_hat = inner(v, fj, output_array=f_hat)

    # Get left hand side of Poisson's equation
    A = inner(v, div(grad(u)))
    A = A.diags('lil')
    A[-2] = (-1)**np.arange(N)
    A[-1] = np.ones(N)
    A = A.tocsc()
    f_hat[-2] = ue.subs(x, T.domain[0])
    f_hat[-1] = ue.subs(x, T.domain[1])

    u_hat = Function(T)
    u_hat[:] = scp.linalg.spsolve(A, f_hat)
    uj = u_hat.backward()

    # Compare with analytical solution
    ua = Array(T, buffer=ue)
    l2_error = np.linalg.norm(uj-ua)
    return l2_error
!ec

For example, we find the error of a Chebyshev discretization
using 12 quadrature points as

!bc pycod
main(12, 'Chebyshev')
!ec

To get the convergence we call `main` for a list
of $N=[12, 16, \ldots, 48]$, and collect the errornorms in
arrays to be plotted. The error can be plotted using
"matplotlib": "https://matplotlib.org".


!bc pycod
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

N = range(12, 50, 4)
error = {}
for basis in ('legendre', 'chebyshev'):
    error[basis] = []
    for i in range(len(N)):
        errN = main(N[i], basis)
        error[basis].append(errN)

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
for basis, col in zip(('legendre', 'chebyshev'), ('r', 'b')):
    plt.semilogy(N, error[basis], col, linewidth=2)
plt.title('Convergence of Tau Poisson solvers 1D')
plt.xlabel('N')
plt.ylabel('Error norm')
plt.legend(('Legendre', 'Chebyshev'))
plt.show()
!ec

The spectral convergence is evident and we can see that
after $N=40$ roundoff errors dominate as the errornorm trails off around $10^{-14}$.
